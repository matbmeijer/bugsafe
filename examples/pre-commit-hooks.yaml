# Example pre-commit configuration for bugsafe
#
# This file shows how to integrate bugsafe with pre-commit.
# Copy the relevant sections to your project's .pre-commit-config.yaml
#
# For more information, see: https://pre-commit.com/

# To use bugsafe as a pre-commit hook, add this to your .pre-commit-config.yaml:
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      # Scan staged files for secrets before committing
      - id: bugsafe-scan
        name: bugsafe secret scan
        entry: bugsafe scan
        language: system
        types: [text]
        description: Scans files for secrets and credentials

      # Alternative: Use uvx to run without installing
      - id: bugsafe-scan-uvx
        name: bugsafe secret scan (uvx)
        entry: uvx bugsafe scan
        language: system
        types: [text]
        description: Scans files for secrets using uvx
# Example usage in your project:
#
# 1. Install pre-commit: pip install pre-commit
# 2. Copy the hooks above to your .pre-commit-config.yaml
# 3. Run: pre-commit install
# 4. Now bugsafe will scan for secrets on every commit
#
# To scan all files manually:
#   pre-commit run bugsafe-scan --all-files
